## What is ZBrush?

**ZBrush** is the industry's leading **digital sculpting software**, used by professional artists and studios worldwide to create highly detailed 3D models, characters, and environments. Unlike traditional 3D modeling applications, ZBrush uses a proprietary "pixol" technology that allows artists to sculpt with unparalleled freedom and detail. It combines 3D modeling, texturing, and painting into one streamlined workflow, making it an essential tool for game development, film production, and 3D printing.

With ZBrush, artists can:
- Sculpt multi-million polygon models in real-time.
- Use dynamic brushes for organic and hard-surface modeling.
- Paint and texture models with advanced material systems.
- Prepare models for 3D printing or other pipelines.

Its powerful feature set, including ZRemesher, DynaMesh, and NanoMesh, empowers artists to bring their creative visions to life with precision and efficiency. ZBrush is renowned for its ability to handle extremely high polygon counts, enabling the creation of intricate details that are essential for modern digital art and production.
